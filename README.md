A Lean Modal Text Editor

Vem is a modal text editor based on Vim. With it you can completely edit your
files by just using the keyboard. Actions are assigned to keys by position,
like in a map, and they are placed in such a way that common actions feel very
comfortable to type.

While Vim makes available hundreds of keyboard commands, Vem focuses on a much
small set of them that is easier to remember and that feels right to use.
