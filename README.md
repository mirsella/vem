# Vem

A Lean Modal Text Editor

Vem is a modal text editor for code and prose based on Vim. With it you can
completely edit your files by just using the keyboard. Actions are assigned to
keys by position, like in a map, and they are placed in such a way that common
actions feel very comfortable to type.

While Vim makes available hundreds of keyboard commands, Vem focuses on a much
small set of them that is easier to remember and that feels right to use!

**Vem is currently in an alpha version. Documentation is in the works and testing
is being performed. Not ready for real use yet!**
